# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

The project's goal was to analyze an ecommerce dataset using SQL, encompassing tables like all_sessions, analytics, products, sales_by_sku, and sales_report. The process involved exploring, cleaning, and transforming the data to answer specific questions and reveal significant patterns.

Exploration:
Understanding the data involved exploring its contents, identifying connections between tables, and addressing data discrepancies and datatypes.

Data Cleaning:
The data was cleaned to ensure consistency and usability, including refining datatypes, removing duplicates, and creating appropriate keys.

Answering Questions:
Queries were formulated to provide insights and answers to specific questions, emphasizing reusability.

Quality Assurance:
A robust QA process was established, verifying results and maintaining data integrity across analyses.

By employing these strategies, the project aimed to gain valuable insights into the ecommerce dataset through effective SQL analysis.

## Process

The project's aim was to analyze an ecommerce dataset using SQL, which included tables such as all_sessions, analytics, products, sales_by_sku, and sales_report. The initial phase involved understanding the data, where some tables were straightforward, but all_sessions and analytics proved more challenging due to their complexity and connections.

To clean the data, various observations were made, including handling NULL entries, eliminating duplication, and ensuring data consistency. Column renaming and datatype adjustments were also undertaken to enhance usability.

Formulating and answering questions involved constructing queries to gain valuable insights, ensuring reusability, and maintaining data integrity. A Quality Assurance (QA) process was implemented to double-check complex query results and verify data consistency.

The project successfully extracted, transformed, and analyzed the dataset, providing valuable insights into the ecommerce data. Techniques like data extraction, pre-processing, transformation, and analysis were employed, utilizing SQL functions, aggregations, and joins to answer specific business questions effectively.

## Results

Exploring Visitor Behaviors:

The analytics and all_sessions tables provided valuable insights into visitor behaviors, shedding light on their frequency, duration, product views, and engagement patterns. Surprisingly, customers spending more time on the site, viewing more products, and having more visits were less likely to make a purchase, challenging traditional assumptions.

Geographical Purchase Trends:

Geographical location played a significant role in revenue generation, with the United States leading in online shopping activity. Other countries may require tailored marketing strategies to improve reach. Geographical location also influenced product preferences, with more affluent cities and countries generating higher revenue.

Revenue Generation and Product Insights:

Notable patterns emerged in revenue generation, with top products like security cameras and thermostats contributing significantly to revenue. Even smaller items, such as a stainless steel water bottle and a satin black ballpoint pen, proved valuable contributors.

Summary of Data-Driven Insights:

Through data-driven insights, businesses can refine marketing strategies, optimize revenue streams, and enhance product offerings. The analysis enables data-driven decision-making, a competitive edge in the market, and continuous improvement in overall business performance.

Queries and Discoveries:

The analysis involved various queries, including identifying high-revenue cities/countries, average products ordered in different locations, popular product categories, and top-selling products per city/country. It also revealed the impact of revenue from different channels and the most frequently purchased products by country. The top five most viewed product categories were also determined.

Overall, the project provided comprehensive insights into customer behavior, revenue generation, and product preferences, empowering businesses to make informed decisions and excel in the competitive ecommerce landscape.

## Challenges 
Challenges Encountered in the Project:

1. Establishing Meaningful Relationships:
* Difficulty in Identifying Primary Keys: The task of identifying primary keys between the all_sessions and analytics tables posed challenges, hindering direct relationship establishment.
* Alternative Approaches: Required innovative methods to create meaningful connections and perform effective data analysis.

2. Ambiguity in Data Representation:
* Unclear Column Values: Certain columns had ambiguous value representations, making it hard to understand their intended meaning.
* Undefined Meanings: Some variables lacked clear definitions, leading to confusion during data interpretation.

Addressing these challenges demanded thorough data exploration, creative problem-solving, and contextual analysis of the dataset. Despite the complexities, the project successfully generated valuable insights through meticulous data analysis and interpretation.

## Future Goals
Future Goals:

In the future, two primary areas of focus will be data quality assurance and advanced analysis with visualization. To ensure data accuracy and completeness, comprehensive data profiling will be conducted, and any identified data quality issues will be addressed promptly. Validating data conformity to business requirements will be a priority to maintain data integrity.

The second area of emphasis involves leveraging advanced statistical techniques to gain deeper insights and uncover patterns within the dataset. Interactive visualizations will be created to effectively present the findings and enable better data-driven decision-making. Additionally, exploring additional business questions, such as customer behavior and preferences, and conducting segmentation analysis on specific customer segments or product categories will further enhance the understanding of the dataset and lead to more informed business strategies. To facilitate future analysis, enhanced data documentation will be provided, offering clear descriptions of tables, relationships, and data transformations, enabling seamless collaboration and knowledge transfer within the organization.
